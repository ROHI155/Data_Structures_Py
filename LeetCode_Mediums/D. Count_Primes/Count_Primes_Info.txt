Count Primes

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: 0

hint: Use the True or False with the multiples of I and J.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Initially, assign the array of all elements as True.
> Check if n equals 0 or 1 and return 0.
> Then assign the array of 0 and 1 as False.
> Create the for loop for 'i' with the range of starting from 2 to the square root of n.
> Check if the arr[i] still has elements.
> Enter the next for loop to mark the multiples of 'i' as False.
	Note: At first, all the elements are marked as True.
> Return the sum of the array.
