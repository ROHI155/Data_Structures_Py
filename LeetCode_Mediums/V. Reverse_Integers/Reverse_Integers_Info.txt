Reverse Integers.

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Assign the is_negative to x < 0.
> Store the absolute values of x in x.
> Initially assign the rev_num as 0.
> Opens a loop whether the x is greater than 0.
> Proceed with a calculation on the rev_num identification.
> Check if the obtained rev_num is 0  then store the negative of the rev_num in rev_num.
> Fix the range of rev_num, and if it exceeds the range, then return it as 0.
> Return the rev_num.
> End the program.
