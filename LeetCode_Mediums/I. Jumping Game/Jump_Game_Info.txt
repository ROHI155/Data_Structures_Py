Jump Game

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index

Hint: Greedy algorithm is to be used to solve this.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Assigning the res as the length of nums.
> Open a for loop and list the range of len(nums) which needs to be decremented till the last value.
> If the sum of nums[i]+i is greater than or equal to the res, then assign the res = I.
> In Outside the loop, check if the result equals 0, which means return True.
> Else return false. 
> End the program.
