Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.


 

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
Example 2:

Input: digits = ""
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Creating a dictionary of all the necessary mappings of numbers and letters.
> Check if the digits are empty, meaning return the empty list.
> Create an empty list to store the results.
> Create a loop to iterate through each value in the digits.
> Create a temp to store the results in the list.
> Open a loop to obtain the matches of letters corresponding to the digits.
> A loop to store the results in temp
> Assign the temp to the results and return the result.
> End the program.
