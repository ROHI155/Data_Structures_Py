Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:

There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Create an empty default dict with the name of anagrams.
> Open a for loop to iterate through each element in the list.
> Sort the element i, join them as a whole, and store it in the sorted list.
> Append the value of i and the sort as key to the dictionary.
> Return the elements in the created list.
> End the program.
