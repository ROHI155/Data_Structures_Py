Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Open an empty list out.
> Create a loop to iterate and sort each list element based on the 0th value.
> Check if the list out is not empty and the values of out[-1][1] is less than or equal to i[0].
> If true means, obtain the max of out[-1][1] and [1].
> If the out is empty, then append the value to the out.
> Return the out 
> End the program.
