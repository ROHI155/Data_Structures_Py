Zigzag Conversion

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
 
Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Returning the s if the given range is 0.
> Assigning the i and a and rows with their perspectives
> To iterate through each element in the s.
> Appending the i in c.
> If i is equal to 0 means assign a value of 1.
> check if it is equal to the numRows - 1, then assign the d as negative 1.
> Increment the I.
> Creating the empty list.
> for joining the element in the ret.
> Returning the ret.
