Number of Islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

Hint: Use DFS to solve this problem.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Initialize the row and column with the length of the grid and grid[0].
> Create and assign the nums_Islands as 0.
> Create a function to mark the neighboring '1' as '0'.
> Create a condition if the values in the range and the value of the grid are not equal to 'i' means just return as empty.
> else, perform the conversion of '1' to '0' in all four directions.
> Create the loop to iterate through each row and column as I and j.
> Check the condition if the grid value is equal to '1', which means increment the nums_Islands by one.
> At the end, return the nums_Islands.
> End the program.
