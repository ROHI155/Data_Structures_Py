Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Initialize an list with the correct length of the nums.
> Assign the Initial preffix and suffix values as 1.
> Create a for loop and iterate through the values of i for the side of prefix.
> Assign the final list with the prefix values.
> Assign the prefix with the product of prefix with nums of i.
> Create the second for loop for performing the second calc suffix.
> Assign the final list  with the product of final of j and suffix.
> return the list and end the program.
