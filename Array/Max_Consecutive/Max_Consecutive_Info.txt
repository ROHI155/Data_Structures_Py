Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Here we are using the two-pointer method

Algorithm:
> Start the program.
> Initialize the value to the left pointer and output as 0.
> Open the for loop and enumerate the list index in it.
> check if n is equal to 0
> If true, update the left pointer index.
> Store the max consecutive count in the output.
> Return the output at the end of the for loop.
> End the program.
