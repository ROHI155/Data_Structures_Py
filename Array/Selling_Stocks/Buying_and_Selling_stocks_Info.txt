You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Hint: Here we are using the Two pointer method.

Algorithm:
> Start the program.
> Initialize the right and left pointer values as 0 and 1.
> Assign max profit as 0
> Create the while loop and give the condition as while right is greater than the left.
> Check the condition if price of right is greater than the left
> If true means, then update the profit as right pointer differenced from the left pointer.
> If the profit is greater then the max then assign the profit value to max.
> else increment the left and the right pointer.
> return the max profit.
> End the program.
