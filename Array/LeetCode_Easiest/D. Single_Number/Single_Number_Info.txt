Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

Hint: Here we are using another dict for counting the elements

Algorithm:
> Initialize a empty dictionary.
> Create a for loop and update the nums values one by one.
> Check if the i th element is not present in the dict means update the element and provide the count.
> else then delete the element.
> after the loop ended return the key only and it should be in list with the index od 0.
