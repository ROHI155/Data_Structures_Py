Toeplitz Matrix

Given an m x n matrix, return true if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return false.

A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Iterate through each column in the list.
> Iterate through each row in the list.
> Check if the current value of [row][col] is equals to [row + 1][col + 1].
> If true, it means return true.
> Else return false.
