Two Sum 
Question:
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

> You can return the answer in any order.

Solution:

Here we are using something new like difference

suppose if the target is 5 means 
num = [1,3,4,6]
target = 5

num [1] = 1-5 = 4
Here the difference contains the remaining values and the index of the orginal value(1)
num [2] = 4-3 not equal to 0
num [3] = 4-4 = 0 It updates the value and the index also
difference = [4:01,0:03]

this is about the checking the value is present already or not if not means we are storing the value and the index.

Algorithm:

> Initialize a dictionary.
> create a for loop to switch the indexes.
> caluclate the difference using the target and the actual value and store the index.
> Using conditional stmts check whether the value is previously occured or not
> if not means please update the difference and index of the actual values.
> If present means return the current and the previous index.
