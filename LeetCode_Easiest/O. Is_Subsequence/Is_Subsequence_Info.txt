Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Assign the j as 0.
> Check if the s is empty. If True means, return True.'
> Open a for loop to iterate through each element in the t.
> Check if the value of t is equal to the value of s.
> Check if the j is equal to the length of s-1.
> Then return True.
> Increment the j by one.
> At the end, return False.
> End the program.
