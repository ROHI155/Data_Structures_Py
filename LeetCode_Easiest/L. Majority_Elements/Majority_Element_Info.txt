Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 
Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Initializing the max and major as 0.
> Loop to iterate through each element in the list.
> Checking the count is greater than max.
> Store the major as value of I.
> Incrementing the count base on condition.
> Return major.
> End the program.
