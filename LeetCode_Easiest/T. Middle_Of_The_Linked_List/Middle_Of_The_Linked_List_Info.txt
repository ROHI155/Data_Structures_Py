Middle of the Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Note: Refer ref_1 and ref_2 for reference purposes.

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Assign the fast and slow as head.
> Iterate through the head using loop.
> Assign the fast and slow as the next upcoming elements.
> Return the slow at the end of the loop.
> End the program.
