A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Assign the left and the right pointers as o and len(s)-1.
> Check if l is less than r.
> Check that the values on the left and the right are alphanumeric.
> Then increment the pointer by 1.
> Check the value of the right is alphanumeric.
> Decrement the pointer by 1.
> Check if the left value is not equal to the right value.
> True means return false.
> Increment and decrement the pointers by 1.
> At the end, return true.
> End the program.
