Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> if x < 0: return False # If the x is less than 0, return false.
> Assign the org as x.
> Assign the rev as 0.
> A loop to perform calculations iteratively.
> The x is modulus with 10 and stored in digit.
> Performing the rev.
> If the org matches the rev, return true.
> Else returning false.
