Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Note: Please use ref_1 for the reference purposes. 

Example 1:


Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 
Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Creating an empty list and adding the element -1.
> Assign the current as dummy.
> Checks the list1 and list2 for values.
> Check if the values of list1 are smaller than list2.
> If True means, assign the current.next as list1
> Assign the current to list1.
> Advances the list1 to its next element.
> Else the values of the list is not less than list2.
> Assign the current.next to list2.
> Assign the current as list2.
> Advances the list2 to its next element.
> If list1 still has remaining values.
> Perform the elements insertion on lists1.
> If list2 still has remaining values.
> Perform the elements insertion on lists1.
> Return the dummy list.
> End the program.
