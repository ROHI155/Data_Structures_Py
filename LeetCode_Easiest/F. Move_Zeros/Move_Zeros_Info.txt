Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Algorithm:

> Start the program.
> Initialize two pointer one is i and assign it as 0.
> Another one as the for loop with j with the range of len of nums.
> Inside the for loop, create a conditional statement and check if the j is not equal to 0.
> If, true means swap the values of nums
	using nums[j] ,nums[i] = nums[i], nums[j].
> Then increment the first pointer by one.
> End the program.
